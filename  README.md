 T he data generated every day is huge, the time of Big Data has arrived. The data are mainly pictures and videos. Nearest neighbors search  under large-scale data has also become an urgent problem to be solved. In order to solve this problem, researchers proposed content proposed content base image technology in the 1990s, in which image retrieval is based on the vision features extracted from image content. But because of the curse of dimensionality and the time complexity of similarity distance function, the performance and efficiency of CBIR are not well.

In hashing algorithm, each term in the database is represented by a compact binary code, which not only significantly reduces the data storage, but also reduce the data dimension. So recently hashing based approximate nearest neighbors search has attracted much attention, and extensive hashing algorithms have been proposed. I  designed and implemented a prototype retrieval system based on a hashing. The system provides visual retrieval services for hashing-based image retrievalâ€™s research, and meantime it can run current mainstream hashing algorithms .
